Welcome to the "School Management" demo!

This application has been entirely made with Wakanda.

You can use it by signing in as one of these roles: administrator, student or teacher.

As an Administrator, you have a full read-write access to the database.â€¨You can register the new users (either teachers or students), update their personal information, and assign them to a study group. You can manage the course calendar and assign a teacher to a course.

As a teacher or student, you can only display your personal calendar containing your courses.

Try it !
